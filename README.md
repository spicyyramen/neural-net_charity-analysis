# Neural Network Model - Charity Analysis

## Project Overview

## Results

### Data Preprocessing
- ***Target variables***: The target variable is the `IS_SUCCESSFUL` column, indicating whether or not the money was used effectively.
- ***Features***: The features were all the columns except the target column, and the ID columns (`EIN` and `NAME`)
- ***Removeable variables***: The variables that were removed were the `EIN` and `NAME` columns- since these columns are simply identifiers and do not contribute to whether the money was used effectively.

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- Neurons, layers, and activation functions
- Was target model performance achieved?
- Steps taken to optimize model

## Summary
- Overall results
- recommendation for how a different model could solve this classification problem
